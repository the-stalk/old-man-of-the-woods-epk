                Old Man of the Woods is an ethereal electro-pop experiment in memory and mirage from Seattle-based multidisciplinary artist Miranda Elliott. Marrying the synthesized sounds of her inner world and those carefully collected from the outer world, Miranda molds a sonic locket, filling it with crooned confessions. Steeped in surrealism, romanticism, and horror, she identifies as a ghost, destined to wander in circles, repeating rhythms, alchemizing anguish, until at last she earns her escape from the loop. And yet each step is increasingly poignant, begging the question, is escape even the point? Embracing the levity of such absurdity, whether floating across the stage or whispering airy incantations from ear to ear, she invites listeners to muse and move through immersive, enchanting audiovisual performances. Having toured her debut LP <i>Votives</i> and EPs <i>Dissolve</i> & <i>Devolve</i> across the Pacific Northwest and New York, she’s poised to release her second LP <i>Tendrils</i> this June, a haunting collection of intimate, atmospheric devotionals recorded while an artist in residence with Culterim Gallery at a lakeside abandoned sanatorium outside of Berlin.

<!--                <h2>Tendrils</h2>-->
<!--                <p>-->
<!--                    <i>Tendrils</i> is a collection of devotionals, written at a yearning distance from their beloveds. It’s the recognition of the vines that bind us to all we adore, at times only felt once they become taut, begin to quiver, reverberate, fray, snap, curl. And the realization that there will always be more, weeds crawling through cracks, for those who stay hungry.-->
<!--                    <br><br>-->
<!--                    Recorded while an artist in residence with Culterim Gallery at a lakeside former sanatorium in Biesenthal, Germany, the album itself is preserved in amber. Any attempt to interfere once leaving erased some essential essence of the estate’s eerie serenity, forcing Elliott to choose peeling walls over perfection. Each room dense with memory, a century-old space intended for healing in isolation, for walks around the lake that Elliott too circled endlessly each day, pen in hand, one’s left to wonder whose tendrils she really writes of, or if we’re all entwined.-->
<!--                    <br><br>-->
<!--                    Vesperal vocals echo from cracked windows and walls, coating the consumptive cathedral, forming an organic organ. Oozing oscillations transform studio into swamp. Damp footsteps haunt the halls, sometimes pacing, sometimes with purpose, demanding to be let in. Whispered truths lay waiting for whoever needs to hear them. With Old Man of the Woods, there’s always a breeze, a blush, an invitation to sway and engage, if you choose to accept.-->

                <h1>Now</h1>
                <h2>Triptych I: Devolve</h2>
                <p>
                    Alchemizing shit into sustenance, Elliott crafts intimate, entrancing songs under the alias of a private, prickly mushroom that survives by the same creed. Born the only child of a landscape painter and Jungian analyst, Elliott was pre-destined to suffer from an aching yearning to be a tree, insatiable curiosity about humanity, and insomnia-inducing creative obsession. Each of these traits is noticeably present in her 2020 EP <i>Dissolve</i> and 2021 LP <i>Votives</i>. Wrapping earnest crooned reflections in a warm glow of verdant electronic arrangements and atmospheric field recordings, they “blur the line between the personal and the natural world, conjuring a vivid and sometimes eerie soundscape as damp and rich as the woodland floor” (Various Small Flames).
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Triptych</i>, Elliott’s next EP series, gets darker. Described as “goth ethereal mycelial”, it descends into the shadow realm, eclipsing innocence with explorations of embodiment, eroticism, and envy. Without compromising on the organic or enigmatic, its production embraces a minimalist physicality, newly unafraid of rawness and repetition. Lyrically, it’s more profane and absurd than anything Elliott has dared to release prior, yet almost ironically it’s the first collection of songs she has performed on stage since their conception, having finally begun playing live shows in 2023. Spanning stages across the US, this exercise in creative embodiment has shifted the nature of what Elliott is attracted to singing and creating. Writing has become less about the purging of despair and more about the exploration and empowerment of alter ego and taboo.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Triptych I: Devolve</i> is the first installment in this new series - a visceral villain’s arc, tracing her devolution from possession to obsession to dissolution. Repurposing the narrative three-panel structure of religious iconography, the EP paints her fall from grace, hunger for vengeance, and embrace of newfound darkness, encouraging listeners to unravel in unison.

                <h1>& Then</h1>
                <h2>Votives</h2>
                <p>
<!--                    When Elliott grew up, she wanted to be a tree. The only child of a landscape painter, the forest felt like kin. Born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, she spent her youth exploring the James River, Blue Ridge Mountains, and her own backyard, drawn to the mystery of dense green and deep blue. It allowed her to fill in the blanks, to invent the strange creature that must have rustled those leaves, to construct a constant fantasy within reality.-->
<!--                    <br><br>-->
<!--                    Elliott would bring that embellished worldview to everything. She photographed vacant factories, calling them urban cathedrals. She saw crumbling walls and peeling paint as abstract compositions of texture and line. She viewed the world as a perpetual collage that could be rearranged and reimagined.-->
<!--                    <br><br>-->
<!--                    Old Man of the Woods is born of that mentality. Elliott describes her creative process as the alchemy of shit into sustenance, naming the project after a dark, scruffy mushroom that survives by the same creed. Created in her home studio in Richmond, her 2020 debut EP <i>Dissolve</i> “blurs the line between the personal and the natural world, conjuring a vivid and sometimes eerie soundscape as damp and rich as the woodland floor” (Various Small Flames).-->
<!--                    <br><br>-->
<!--                    Old Man of the Woods’ 2021 debut album <i>Votives</i> invites us deeper into Elliott’s imagination. -->
                    The debut full length album from Old Man of the Woods.
                    Flickering between devotion and resentment, affection and isolation, faith and doubt, <i>Votives</i> forms a sonic labyrinth guided by a dream that our minds are little churches filled with votives burning for everyone we’ve loved. The first three tracks construct a triptych - beginning with ‘Garden’, an ambient hum evolving with repetition from a hesitant fascination to an unwavering trust, where the candle is lit; moving to ‘Let Me Miss You’, a ukulele-strummed post-breakup plea that begs to feel nostalgic instead of hurt, where it still burns for a memory; then to ‘Votives’, a danceable bass-driven reminder to let go of the memories that only weigh us down, where we blow it out. As the album progresses, these themes repeat, morph, and steep. We grieve our lost loves and lost selves, slowly growing stronger and more assured, with honest moments of weakness along the way. Written from 2018 to 2021, <i>Votives</i> is a journey through what it means to love and be human and make mistakes and keep going. Wrapped in a warm fog of dreamy harmonies and swirling synths, it reminds us that love is magic, release is vital, and movement is forever.

                <h2>Dissolve</h2>
                <i>Dissolve</i> is Old Man of the Woods’ debut EP, made in Elliott’s Richmond home studio during a month of endless winter rain and bad bout of bronchitis. Everything clouded and waterlogged, the boundary between environment and self began to fade. Wrapped in a warm fog, yearning vocals float through waves of synth and heartbeats of bass, conjuring a world equally intimate and organic. She found comfort in letting herself dissolve, and hopes you will too.
